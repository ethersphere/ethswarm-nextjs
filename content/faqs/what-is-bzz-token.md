# What is BZZ Token?

**BZZ** is Swarm's native token, initially issued on **Ethereum**. It has been bridged to **Gnosis Chain** where it is referred to as **xBZZ**.

BZZ serves as a means of accessing the platform's data relay and storage services, while also providing compensation for node operators who provide these services.
