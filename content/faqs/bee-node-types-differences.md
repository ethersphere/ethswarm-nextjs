# What are the differences between Bee node types?

A Bee node can be configured to run in three modes depending on your use case. For a detailed comparison, visit the [quick start guide](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/bee/installation/quick-start).

&nbsp;

**Ultra-light node**

Connects you to the Swarm network with limited access — you can download data but **cannot store data** on the network. Can be upgraded to a Light node by topping up its wallet address.

*Does not earn storage or bandwidth incentives.*

&nbsp;

**Light node**

Allows you to download and upload files as well as send and receive PSS messages. Ideal for **dApp developers**, **content creators**, and **consumers** who want to actively build on Swarm. Can be started by upgrading from an Ultra-light node.

*Does not earn storage or bandwidth incentives.*

&nbsp;

**Full node**

Participates fully in the network by storing and forwarding data for other nodes. **Eligible for storage and bandwidth incentives.** Requires staking **xBZZ** and meeting the [hardware requirements](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/bee/installation/install/#1-install-bee).
