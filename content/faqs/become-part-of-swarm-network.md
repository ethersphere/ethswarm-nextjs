# How can I become part of the Swarm network?

You can become part of the network by running a **Bee node**. Bee is a peer-to-peer client that connects you with other peers all over the world to become part of Swarm — a global distributed p2p storage network that aims to store and distribute all of the world's data.

Depending on your needs you can run an:

* **Ultra-light node** — download data only
* **Light node** — upload and download data
* **Full node** — store, forward, and earn incentives
