# What is the easiest way to run an Ultra-light or Light bee node?

The quickest and easiest way to run a lightweight bee node (ultra-light or light node) on your desktop is with the **Swarm Desktop app** - [ethswarm.org/build/desktop](https://www.ethswarm.org/build/desktop). The Swarm Desktop app starts a bee node in Ultra Light mode by default.
