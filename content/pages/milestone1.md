        ## Host unstoppable content on Swarm


        Uploading and downloading content such as websites or nft-data is
        optimised and predictable. This functionality can be accessed through
        all Swarm products:


        * bee

        * gateway

        * swarm-cli

        * chrome extension

        * dashboard

        * bee-js


        ## Measuring success


        * Small data and dapps (\~5MB) can be uploaded and downloaded reliably

        * Websites can be accessed by means of a human-readable name without the
        need for completing a blockchain transaction for every update


        ## Completed


        Q4 2021


        ## Value


        With this goal achieved, Swarm further unlocks the following features:


        * Permissionless upload and download

        * Robust defences against blocking or changing access to content once
        published

        * Auto-scaling with increased demand

        * Integrity protected content

        * Eventually forgetting content that is no longer relevant to preserve
      border: false
