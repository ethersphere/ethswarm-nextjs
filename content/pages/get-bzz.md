          title: Is the token supply deflationary like Bitcoin?
          content: The token supply is not fixed and can increase or decrease via
            the bonding curve. Put simply, if the supply goes up by one token, so
            does its price in the bonding curve contract, and vice versa. This makes
            BZZ neither inflationary nor deflationary. You can read about Swarm’s
            supply and bonding curve in detail [here](https://medium.com/ethereum-swarm/swarm-and-its-bzzaar-bonding-curve-ac2fa9889914).

          title: Will I receive BZZ if I run a full node?
          content: The storage incentives system compensates storage providers through
            a redistribution mechanism, depending on the amount of BZZ tokens they
            stake, and whether or not they are selected for redistribution. Read more
