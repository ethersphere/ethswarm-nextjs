      title: Swarm Grant Waves
      content: |-
        The purpose of Swarm grant waves is to enable developers, researchers, the community and artists to get to know Swarm and start exploring by creating proof(s)-of-concept, and MVPs that showcase their vision. This is just the start of collaboration. Those who successfully reach their milestones can apply for follow-up grants.

        If you have any questions regarding the process, reach out to the Swarm team on Discord.
