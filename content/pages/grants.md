          title: Swarm Grant Waves
          content: >-
            The purpose of Swarm grant waves is to enable developers,
            researchers, the community and artists to get to know Swarm and
            start exploring by creating proof(s)-of-concept, and MVPs that
            showcase their vision. This is just the start of collaboration.
            Those who successfully reach their milestones can apply for
            follow-up grants.


            If you have any questions regarding the process, reach out to the
            Swarm team on Discord.

                  A spam-free, secure and decentralized email service on top of
                  Swarm, inspired by the idea of a mail-transfer protocol
                  proposed by Daniel J. Bernstein in which the sender, and not
                  the recipient, is responsible for storing the email messages.

                  Sovr extends the compute capabilities of the FairOS-dfs by
                  integrating toolings of the Golem network. The idea is to
                  offer people compute pods: recipes for setting up, running,
                  and finally collecting the results of a dapp execution
                  session. Users can fork, share, and modify compute pods in an
                  easy and intuitive manner.
