          title: Swarm Grant Waves
          content: >-
            Swarm grant waves enable developers, researchers, the community, and artists to familiarise themselves with Swarm by creating proofs-of-concept and minimum viable products (MVPs) that reflect their vision. The initial grants mark the beginning of collaboration, and those who achieve their milestones successfully are eligible to apply for subsequent grants.


            If you have any questions regarding the process, reach out to a Swarm team member on the official [Swarm Discord server](https://discord.gg/wV5sm2bkhF).

                  A spam-free, secure and decentralised email service on top of
                  Swarm, inspired by the idea of a mail-transfer protocol
                  proposed by Daniel J. Bernstein in which the sender, and not
                  the recipient, is responsible for storing the email messages.

                  Sovr extends the compute capabilities of the FairOS-dfs by
                  integrating toolings of the Golem network. The idea is to
                  offer people compute pods: recipes for setting up, running,
                  and finally collecting the results of a dapp execution
                  session. Users can fork, share, and modify compute pods in an
                  easy and intuitive manner.
