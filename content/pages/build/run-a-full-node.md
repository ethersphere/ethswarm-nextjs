          Full node operators share their disk space with the Swarm network 
          and are in turn rewarded for their services through a robust and 
          self sustaining incentive system built with blockchain based 
          smart-contracts and powered by the BZZ token.

          title: Incentivised P2P Storage
          content: |-
            Swarm uses the blockchain to provide a layer of incentivisation that has been missing from P2P file sharing and data transfer technologies in the decades since their inception.

            Built-in incentives have been designed to optimise the allocation of bandwidth (SWAP) and storage resources (Postage stamps) to render Swarm economically self-sustaining.

            Swarm nodes track relative bandwidth contribution on each peer connection, and excess debt due to unequal consumption can be settled in BZZ. Publishers in Swarm must spend BZZ to purchase the right to write data to Swarm and prepay some rent for long term storage.

                  Running a full Swarm node enables the vision of a decentralised 
                  P2P data storage network which empowers web3 publishers 
                  and app developers to make their content unstoppable.

                  Swarm cultivates a nurturing ground in which vital public 
                  data initiatives like Open Street Maps can be collectively 
                  funded by their community members.
