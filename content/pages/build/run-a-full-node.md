          The Swarm Network achieves economic self-sustainability through a robust incentive system built with blockchain based smart-contracts. This system is powered by the BZZ token which serves as the foundation of Swarm's incentivization model.

          title: Incentivised P2P Storage
          content: |-
            Swarm uses the blockchain to provide a layer of incentivisation that has been missing from P2P file sharing and data transfer technologies in the decades since their inception.

            Built-in incentives have been designed to optimise the allocation of bandwidth (SWAP) and storage resources (Postage stamps) to render Swarm economically self-sustaining.

            Swarm nodes track relative bandwidth contribution on each peer connection, and excess debt due to unequal consumption can be settled in BZZ. Publishers in Swarm must spend BZZ to purchase the right to write data to Swarm and prepay some rent for long term storage.
