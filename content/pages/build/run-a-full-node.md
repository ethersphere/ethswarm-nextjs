          The Swarm Network is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in
          incentive system built on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Swarm
          incentives are enabled by the BZZ token.

          title: Incentivised P2P Storage
          content: |-
            Swarm uses the blockchain to provide a layer of incentivisation that has been missing from p2p file sharing and data transfer over decades of peer-to-peer research.

            Built-in incentives seek to optimise the allocation of bandwidth (SWAP) and storage resources (Postage stamps) and render Swarm economically self-sustaining.

            Swarm nodes track their relative bandwidth contribution on each peer connection, and excess debt due to unequal consumption can be settled in BZZ. Publishers in Swarm must spend BZZ to purchase the right to write data to Swarm and prepay some rent for long term storage.
