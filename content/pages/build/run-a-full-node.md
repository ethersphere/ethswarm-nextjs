          Full node operators share their disk space with the Swarm network
          and are in turn rewarded for their services through a robust and
          self sustaining incentive system built with blockchain based
          smart-contracts and powered by the BZZ token.

          title: Incentivised P2P Storage
          content: |-
            Swarm uses the blockchain to provide a layer of incentivisation that has been missing from P2P file sharing and data transfer technologies in the decades since their inception.

            Built-in incentives have been designed to optimise the allocation of bandwidth (SWAP) and storage resources (Postage stamps) to render Swarm economically self-sustaining.

            Swarm nodes track relative bandwidth contribution on each peer connection, and excess debt due to unequal consumption can be settled in BZZ. Publishers in Swarm must spend BZZ to purchase the right to write data to Swarm and prepay some rent for long term storage.

                  Running a full Swarm node enables the vision of a decentralised
                  P2P data storage network which empowers web3 publishers
                  and app developers to make their content unstoppable.
