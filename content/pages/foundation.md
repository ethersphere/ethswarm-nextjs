          title: About Swarm Foundation
          content: >-
            The goal of the foundation is to support and contribute to the
            creation of a technology whose code will be open to all and will
            allow the storage and exchange of computer data in a decentralised
            manner. To this end, the foundation intends in particular to promote
            and support a community and a sustainable and independent ecosystem
            for the development of free open source software (FLOSS), allowing
            for digital services coordinated by crypto-economic incentives that
            process, distribute and store data.


            Our mission is to empower digital freedom by promoting the
            development and maintenance of the Swarm network, the base layer of
            the emerging fair data economy, and the community surrounding this
            network.


            We do so by supporting many different initiatives, either through
            financial grants or other types of support, all of which is assessed
            on a case-by-case basis.


            Swarm Foundation is complemented with a sister entity, the Swarm
            Association, to support the Swarm community, educate the public
            about decentralised technology, its appropriate uses, and to keep
            the technology neutral.

          title: Ethical Standards
          content: >-
            We must recognise that we have no control over how the Swarm
            ecosystem evolves. As an open project, we can't decide who uses this
            technology and for what.


            However, our moral responsibility as developers of an unstoppable
            technology is to do our best to steer the ecosystem in an ethical
            direction and not repeat the mistakes of the Internet Society. We
            work on our good character, we empower others, and we lead by
            example. We can't control the actions of others, and we don't want
            to; such control is an illusion. We act in a way that is guided by
            virtue and by values including wisdom, justice, courage and
            temperance.


            We do believe that it is important for any organization to apply
            external ethical standards. For this reason, **the Swarm Foundation
            has additionally subscribed to the principles of the Fair Data
            Society**
            ([principles.fairdatasociety.org](https://principles.fairdatasociety.org)).
            By living and endorsing these ethical guidelines, the Swarm
            Foundation is taking a leadership role for a goal bigger than
            oneself – for a fair data society. Given the growing importance of
            data ethics, we believe other projects will follow and join our
            efforts.
