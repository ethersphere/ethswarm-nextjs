          The Swarm Grants Programme, an initiative by the Swarm Association, stands at the forefront of technological evolution, committed to narrowing the gap between Web3 ecosystems and the traditional Web2 space. By empowering a diverse array of talents including developers, researchers, artists, and community activists, we aim to unlock a new realm of digital innovation and collaboration.


          Our mission is to catalyse the development of decentralised technologies that promote digital freedom, aiming for a future where the internet is more inclusive and accessible to all.

            The Swarm Grants Programme offers financial support up to 10,000 DAI in BZZ, with the grants divided into three distinct categories, each tailored to support projects at various stages of development and complexity.


            - __Starter Microgrants (500 - 2,000 USD in BZZ)__<br/>
            Aimed at projects focused on simple Swarm storage integrations or proof-of-concept (PoC) developments, with no prior grants received.


            - __Builder Grants (2,000 - 5,000 USD in BZZ)__<br/>
            Ideal for projects with a functional prototype and clearly defined future development steps.


            - __Booster Grants (Open / Up to 10,000 USD in BZZ)__<br/>
            Reserved for exceptional cases or projects specifically endorsed by the Swarm Association, demonstrating significant potential to advance the Swarm ecosystem.


            Each grant category is designed to facilitate the growth and progress of projects at different maturity levels, from initial ideation to full-scale development, fostering innovation and excellence within the Swarm community.

          title: Key Focus Areas
          content: >-
            The current wave of grants places a particular emphasis on:


            - __Blobs on Swarm:__<br/>
            Enhancing the blob view, facilitating blobs on other chains, adding blob viewers to the Swarm Desktop App, and enabling search functionality over blobs.


            - __Data Availability on Swarm:__<br/>
            Tooling to create open insurance groups for data on Swarm, offering real-time fee comparisons for data availability solutions, and selection tools for upload and data availability solutions for sequencers and developers, ensuring secure and insured off-chain data storage.


            - __Polygon / Cross-Chain Innovation:__<br/>
            Facilitating integrations between Polygon and Swarm to enable scalable, interoperable DApp solutions.


            - __Web3 Social Networking DApps:__<br/>
            Expanding social and communication DApps for Swarm users, including features like the Swarm mailbox, real-time messaging, and a dedicated social media space. We place a strong emphasis on supporting private identities, ensuring encryption, and providing modularity. This approach allows us to integrate high-quality DApps as both Desktop App plugins and Fairdrive components.
