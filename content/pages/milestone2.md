        ## Setting up and interacting with a Bee node is optimised for ease-of-use

        Any crypto enthusiast with an interest in Swarm can set up and run a Bee node easily.

        ## Measuring Success

        * Setting up a node (including crypto-onboarding) on Mac, Windows and Linux can be done in under 30' in >70% of the cases (both mainnet and testnet)
        * User funds are reasonably secure and this is guaranteed by an audit
        * There are multiple documented ways of monitoring and interacting with a Bee node
        * Setting up a Bee-Gateway is documented and easy to set up

        ## Time Estimate

        Q2 2022

        ## Value

        If it is trivial to set up a Bee node, more of them will be set up, which will result in a stronger network. More people will be able to publish and access content (Milestone #1). Through the gateway set-up, developers and communities can easily access the Swarm network.
