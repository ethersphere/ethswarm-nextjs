                  Censorship resistant and private by design, Swarm nodes will
                  provide leak proof messaging and private, unfiltered access to
                  data via a distributed network.

                  Postal Service over Swarm, the Swarm network provides a
                  fertile basis for you to build never before seen completely
                  decentralised applications.

                  Swarm exists so the internet can again be decentralised.
                  Swarm’s vision is to become the operating system of the
                  re-decentralised internet. It provides a scalable and
                  self-sustaining infrastructure for a supply-chain economy of
                  data.

                  Cost of hosting stays same no matter if the content or dapp is
                  accessed by one person or one million due to cryptoeconomic
                  incentives of the network. No more VCs or monetisation needed
                  in order to support popular dapps or content.

                  Since anyone can contribute, Swarm establishes a system for
                  important data commons such as Open Street Maps data to be

                content: >-
                  Nodes use Kademlia routing to arrange themselves in a regular
                  network that gives each node responsibility for storing and
                  forwarding chunks based on the addressing scheme. This means
                  that all nodes can access all of the data in the swarm.

                  When data is uploaded to the swarm, it is split into 4kb
                  chunks and distributed using the Kademlia routing protocol to
                  their closest neighbourhood whose nodes are responsible for
                  storing them. This distributes data evenly across the swarm
                  network.

                content: >-
                  When each full node joins the swarm it becomes part of a
                  global hard drive - chunks in its radius of responsibility are
                  synced from nodes in each node’s radius. This ensures each
                  node is able to serve up chunks that are close to its address
                  when requested by the retrieval protocol.

                title: Retrieval
                content: >-
                  The retrieval protocol routes each node’s request for chunks
                  to the node closest to that chunk’s neighbourhood. In this
                  way, every node in the swarm is able to access chunks from
                  their neighbourhood of responsibility.

          title: How it works
          content: >-
            Swarm provides a native data storage capability that plays nice with
            the blockchain, enabling EVM based smart contracts to parse and
            verify data structures that are contained within its distributed
            DISC.
