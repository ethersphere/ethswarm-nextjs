          [Solar Punk’s](http://www.solarpunk.buzz) proposal outlines a project to develop audio, video streaming, and chat libraries for the Swarm network. These libraries aim to deliver unstoppable, censorship-resistant multimedia solutions, including group chat, audio and video streaming, all powered by Ethereum Swarm's decentralised infrastructure. The project will create a suite of middleware libraries using Vanilla JS, ensuring wide compatibility across various JS frameworks.
          
          The libraries will enable developers to build applications with versatile streaming capabilities, supporting both on-demand and live audio/video streams. Future enhancements are planned to include pre-processing and security features. A white-label sample UI codebase in React will accompany the libraries, demonstrating their usability and offering a reusable foundation for partners.

          title: Context
          content: >-
           The project addresses the increasing demand for decentralised social media platforms and censorship-resistant communication tools within the Web3 ecosystem. It taps into the growing interest from Web3 community, content creators, and developers who are eager to leverage decentralised technologies for multimedia content delivery and social networking. By doing so, the project aims to accelerate the broader adoption of the Swarm network, providing essential building blocks for developing multimedia applications.

          By offering end-to-end, white-label solutions, the project will significantly reduce development costs and time-to-market for customised social media platforms and even advanced metaverse-like experiences. The libraries will facilitate the creation of a wide range of applications, ranging from simple social media platforms to complex, immersive metaverse environments. This ease of accessibility is expected to drive innovation, user adoption, and contribute to the overall growth of the Swarm ecosystem.

          title: Business use case
          content: >-
            The business case for this project revolves around the potential for increased usage and storage demand within the Swarm network. By making streaming and social media more accessible, the project anticipates a surge in network activity, ultimately contributing to the growth and overall value of the Swarm ecosystem. Additionally, Solar Punk Ltd, the organisation behind the project, aims to gain reputational benefits and potential future partnership opportunities as a result of this innovation.

            The project also envisions potential revenue streams through direct project delivery engagements with paying customers, as well as the sale of additional libraries offering advanced features such as in-depth usage analytics and statistics for content providers. These value-added services can support platform developers to implement complex monetisation strategies, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the project.

          title: Benefits
          content: >-
            The primary benefit of the project lies in providing censorship-resistant communication channels for text, audio, and video content. This will greatly benefit the broader Web3 ecosystem and Swarm users, particularly projects focused on community engagement and real-time media streaming. Emerging metaverses, which require reliable and decentralised CDN technologies, are a prime example of potential beneficiaries.
            The project's success will be measured by the adoption of the libraries by at least three external organisations for their communication needs. Achieving this goal will validate the libraries’ effectiveness and showcase their potential, encouraging broader adoption and driving growth within the Swarm network. The project also aligns with the Swarm Foundation's goals of highlighting the network's capabilities and attracting more users and developers to the ecosystem.
