          title: Purpose of Fellowships
          content: >-
            Swarm fellows work on items identified as needs for the Swarm network to evolve and grow but are not part of core Swarm development. Fellows are expected to pursue the goals supported by the fellowship in the long term as part of their career path. A fellowship helps them achieve results to a certain degree, but afterwards, the project should be sustainable and able to continue on its own.


            For example, fellows might develop an important product based on using the Swarm network and extending its usage. They support the network and promote its usage both directly and through the use of their product. They serve as ambassadors for Swarm.


            Fellowships could fall under categories such as:
              - A decentralised protocol tackling a concrete issue or challenge (e.g., communication, personal data management, supply chain, etc.),
              - Tooling for developers,
              - Tools or applications for end users,
              - Developing tech infrastructure to support the Swarm network,
              - And others.

            The work must be available as open source for others to leverage and reuse.
