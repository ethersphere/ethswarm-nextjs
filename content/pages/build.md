            Bee is a peer-to-peer client that connects you with other peers all
            over the world to become part of Swarm network, a global distributed
            p2p storage network that aims to store and distribute all of the
            world's data. Running a full Bee node gives you all the
            functionalities of Swarm.

          title: Layer2 tooling through ecosystem initiatives
          content: >-
            Below are several ecosystem-based projects that enable faster
            development while promoting data interoperability and sovereignty.
            The Swarm Foundation is pleased to support the projects presented,
            but makes no guarantees about how they'll work.


            All projects are in an intensive development phase, but
            contributions are more than welcome. Additionally, contributions to
            the projects listed below can be supported through [**Swarm
            grants**](https://my.ethswarm.org/grants).

                  With fairOS, instead of dealing with chunks and separate files
                  directly on Swarm you can work with a distributed file system,
                  key-value database or database doc (multi-index). fairOS
                  provides developers a head start and a decentralised backend.

                  Fairdrive is decentralised “Dropbox / Google drive”, running
                  on Swarm. A UI for dapp and personal data. (D)apps can save
                  and read data from it, which enables users to reclaim, own and
                  manage their data while enabling developers to use it as a
                  white-label and save on development time.

                content: >-
                  Swarm imagines a plural future with multiple data stores
                  serving different purposes. FDP is the glue between them,
                  enabling interoperability. Currently, the project is under
                  intense development. The community can contribute to or
                  suggest improvements through Fair data improvement proposals.
