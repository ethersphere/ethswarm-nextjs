          The Swarm Foundation is proud to share its core tech team's internal
          agenda for the next 12 months. The aim is to create predictability in
          development tracks and the wider organisation, as well as help
          coordinate between the Foundation's efforts and the efforts deployed
          to the broader Swarm community.

                  End users have a smooth experience starting a node and have
                  the tools to monitor and interact with their local node. Apps
                  connect to nodes and gateways in a secure way. Basic
                  functionality of websites (files and directories) upload and
                  download is optimised for speed and reliability.

                  Dapp Developers are provided with a mature toolkit that can be
                  used to integrate Swarm in their Web3 dapp. This includes
                  extensive and useful documentation, example dapps, and
                  tutorials. They benefit from dashboards monitoring vital
                  metrics displaying the node's operational health. Developers
                  can rely on help provided in dev channels.

                  Node operators are sufficiently incentivised to contribute
                  their bandwidth and storage space. Time-based allowance is
                  calibrated so that clients paying for bandwidth will get
                  reasonable service. As for storage, Postage Stamp revenue is
                  redistributed to storer nodes directly in an efficient way
                  without the need for storage contributors to stake their
                  tokens.

                  Alternative client development is supported by consolidated
                  and structured specifications of the DISC protocols and client
                  strategies. High level standards and APIs are cleared up and
                  documented. Integration, multiclient testing environment and
                  quality assurance tools are provided. Ecosystem projects are
                  provided with grants and fellowships.

                  The Swarm Foundation aims to assist as much as it can in
                  providing scaffoldings to the community to support their own
                  agenda involving Swarm. It encourages autonomous, independent
                  and permissionless communities to take further ownership over
                  the protocol and its usages.
