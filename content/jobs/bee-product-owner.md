### **About Swarm**

Swarm is a system of peer-to-peer networked nodes that create a decentralised storage and communication service. The system is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system enforced through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

Swarm aspires to shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. On Swarm, applications can run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.

Bee is a Swarm client implemented in Go. It’s the basic building block for Swarm Network. Bee provides low level constructs for file storage, feeds, key-value stores and untraceable communication.
