  title: "Researcher & Developer"
  subtitle: GO and Solidity
  description: >-
    The ideal candidate we are looking for is a developer in GO and Solidity that has the mind of a researcher and is better suited to tackling the hard problems of decentralised systems. More than just identifying the issues, they should be able to work and as a team but as a self-starting individual.

        Swarm is a system of peer-to-peer networked nodes for a decentralised storage and communication service. 

        Swarm could shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. On Swarm, applications run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.

        The Swarm Research Team is tasked with rigorously spelling out and analysing Swarm’s underlying theory as well as the current implementation. We create theories, write code, run experiments and make concrete suggestions to Swarm’s engineering teams for further improvements. Our work is consumed by various Swarm teams, as well as the wider (research) community.

        The ideal candidate we are looking for is a developer in GO and Solidity that has the mind of a researcher and is better suited to tackling the hard problems of decentralised systems. More than just identifying the issues, they should be able to work and as a team but as a self-starting individual. 

        They should be able to play a deep part in formalising and documenting problems, fixes and features, and then developing those solutions as defined by the team.

        Must haves:
      titleSize: small
      content: |
        - Multiple years of relevant experience in collaborative, even better if open source, research experience in distributed/decentralised systems. 
        - Focus points that would be ideal experience: privacy, storage, smart contracts, testing, economic incentives. 
        - Communication skills must be excellent and be extremely self motivated and curious regarding technical solutions and not waiting for instructions or specs to present themselves. 
        - Mid level developer in GO and has Solidity experience preferably. Or the propensity to learn and adapt quickly and skill up on these on the fly, if all other relevant skills are present.

        - Ultimately this role is a designated developer role who will execute the solution discussed and formalised in the rounds of research discussions. As such they should have 3+ years of experience on a Research team in a developer capacity. 
        - History of code contributions to opensource projects or private organisations they have worked for is desirable. 
        - A history or proficiency in writing documentation or specifications would be a welcome skill to formalise their work within the team. 
        - At least a year of active development work in a relevant language, or an outsized portfolio of technical contributions in web3 organisations.
