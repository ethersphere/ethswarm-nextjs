    An economically self-sustaining mechanism to gather storage operators.

    Historically, people had two choices when it came to hosting their data: they could either store it themselves or upload it to a trusted third party computer. Regarding the latter, the source of this trust is typically that the host — usually a corporation — is conducting a long term business requiring them to be reliable and reputable. On the other hand, self-hosting requires that one’s computer is online at all times, which is often not feasible.
