      Bee client is now version 1.13.0 and is bringing breaking changes. This
      includes the upgrade of the go-libp2p, which uses a new format for the p2p
      keys. The update will exclude nodes from storage incentives unless they
      have enough balance to cover at least five storage-incentives-related
      transactions.
